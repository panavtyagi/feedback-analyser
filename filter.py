# This omits "transition" sentences. Transition sentences are those that refer to subsequent sentence.
#
# Example: Sentence B comes right after sentence A. Sentence B also refers to sentence A. If sentence
# B is included in the summary but sentence A is not included in the summary, then this will distort
# the meaning of the sentence.
#
# Example: "Cats like to play. They also like to eat". The second sentence here refers to the first.
# Therefore it should be omitted.
